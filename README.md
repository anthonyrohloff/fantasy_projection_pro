Website that can pull projection data from all major fantasy platforms (sleeper, yahoo, nfl, and espn) and compare them for accuracy.
Train an ML model to determine the best one/get a new projection based on the data analysis ("True projection").

With this new "true projection", add the ability to input sleeper league id and output betting lines. Stuff like odds to make playoffs, win ship, etc... 
Make the lines even, no edge to "the house" so people can bet amongst their leaguemates on how their team/other teams will perform.

Create account system so people can make bets, then login later to see if they hit.
Nullify bets if stupid trade happens (how to determine this...)
